Work thru "projecteuler" projecteuler.net.

Pick at least one language from each letter from the github language page. https://github.com/languages

Slightly longer list:

Problem:
Each problem will have its own folder, and each folder below that will be for which ever language I tackle it in from my "Short list".

ie.
1
|-- arc
|-- R
2
|-- Io

etc

At the start of this, I can safely say from my "Short list" I have only used "xquery" via xpath in javascript and php. It should be a fun trip.
