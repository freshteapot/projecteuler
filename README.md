#The Plan

Work thru "projecteuler" projecteuler.net.


Pick from "thelist" at least one language for each problem.

"thelist" must be selected from the github page of languages https://github.com/languages


#Problem:

Each problem will have its own folder, and each folder below that will be for which ever language I tackle it in from my "Short list".

	ie.
	1
	|-- arc
	|-- R
	2
	|-- Io
	etc

At the start of this, I can safely say from my "Short list" I have only used "xquery" via xpath in javascript and php. It should be a fun trip.
